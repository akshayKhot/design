This is a simple template for a Tailwind project. If you are tired of changing a Tailwind class, doing `alt + tab`, and reloading the whole app to see the change, give it a try. 

Tailwind playground is great, but I do like to work with my favorite IDE with my favorite fonts and themes. 

Treat this as your local Tailwind sandbox to quickly build small components. The browser reloads automatically after you make a change and save. Once you're satisfied with a design, copy + paste it in your main project.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akshayKhot/design.git your_project_name
cd your_project_name
yarn
yarn tailwind
yarn server
```

That's it. Now build some great designs.
